hi!

in case you're running a unix-like system (linux/mac os),
you could simply run 'run.sh' file :p
```
bash run.sh
```

otherwise, you could run each server like this:
```
python3 main.py root_folder
```

you could also use custom ports like this, not that you'll need it though!
```
python3 main.py root_folder port
```

## quitting
quit with ctrl + c
