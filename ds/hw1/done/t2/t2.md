# Question 2 (Theory)

## Linked List Definition
``` py
class linked_list_item
    value : field
    next  : linked_list_item
```

## Reverse Function
``` py
reverse_linked_list(current, previous)
    next = current.next
    current.next = previous
    # base case
    if next is null
        return
    # recurse
    else
        reverse_linked_list(next, current)

reverse_linked_list(head : linked_list_item)
    reverse_linked_list(head, null)
    
```
<!-- ### analysis: -->
### time: O(n)

since no item is checked more than once and linked list item references don't have cycles.

### memory: O(1)

only a handful of variables (next, and current and previous in call stack) were used.

it's worth mentioning this code would have memory of O(n) because of call stacks if the programming language used for implementation didn't support tail recursion. in that case we'd change the code to use loops.

## Reverse with k categories
```py
reverse_in_k(_head: linked_list_item, k: int)
    current = _head
    loop                                # O(n/k)
        head = current
        i = 0 
        # reach the 'tail' of sublist with len of k
        while i < k - 1                 # O(k-1)
            # termination condition
            if current is null
                return 
            current = head.next         # O(k-1) x O(n/k)
            i += 1  
        # cut the tail of the sublist
        next = current.next 
        current.next = null
        # update head
        current = next
        # reverse the sublist just made
        reverse_linked_list(head)       # O(k) x O(n/k)
```

### time: O(n)
algorithm only iterates on each member once (maximum) and moves to current.next each time. to be precise the while loop recurses k-1 times each time the loop loops and the loop recurses n/k times. then the most frequently run instruction will be run at O(k-1) * O(n/k) time.
also each call to reverse function takes O(k) time with the length of sublist being k. making the total time n/k * O(k).

### memory: O(1)
the only variables used are current, head and i, which makes them three and order of 1. the reverse function also only uses O(1). so the total memory used is 3 + O(1) \in O(1).
